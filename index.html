    <h1>It sure as heck is!</h1>
 
    <p>And what a wonderful sandbox it is!  Not the one in the picture I mean, although I'm sure 
 that one is very nice as well, but I mean this one here!  HTML/CSS is <em>great</em>, I'm just 
 having a gas with it!</p>
 
    <h2>It's actually not a sandbox at all.</h2>
    
    <p>Not in the sense that I recently heard it.  I mean, yeah, the thing in the picture is
    an actual sandbox, but I was thinking of a metaphor for the computer, which came (as far
    as I know) from the instructions for <a href="http://theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>
    but that had to do with a virtual machine, and it turns out my el cheapo computer (tell
    me if I'm losing you with too much jargon here) won't run the darn thing worth a... well,
    not very well is what I mean to say.</p>
    
    <h1>It's still a darn sandbox!</h1>
    
    <p>Ok, well yeah it is, in the less specific sense. This little home page of mine is a
    great learning project for HTML/CSS.</p>
    
    <p>It's making the idea of having a little more emphasis on web design for my new career kind 
of appealing.  To begin with, I'd been thinking I'd be more like the back end person, but
this is <em>not hard</em> what I'm doing here, and I'm only a few days into my education.</p>

    <p>Well anyway.</p>

    <h2>Ranting about nothing.  Sorry, rambling I mean.</h2>
    <p>Next I'm going to ramble on and on about basically nothing because I have to have some text to go around this picture to see if it's doing what I want.  Previously, there was either a huge unused space where there should have been a text block, or else all this text would be superimposed on the picture, which is not what I want.  Let's see how this is!</p>

    <p>It's actually not so bad.  I'm glad I'm doing this -- I'm learning some really nifty
  things.  I had no clue about color gradients, for example, that stuff is just awesome!</p>
